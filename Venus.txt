Venus is a terrestrial planet and is sometimes called Earth's "sister planet" because of their similar size, mass, 
proximity to the Sun, and bulk composition. It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the 
densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric 
pressure at the planet's surface is 92 times that of Earth, or roughly the pressure found 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater 
on Earth. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the Solar System, with a mean surface temperature of 735 K (462 °C; 863 °F), 
even though Mercury is closer to the Sun.
